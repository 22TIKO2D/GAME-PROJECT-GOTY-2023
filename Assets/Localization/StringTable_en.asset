    m_Localized: "Great job! You couldn\u2019t just maybe do it, you did it. Be confident.
      Companies like confident employees. Even if you aren\u2019t like that, you
      can pretend to be a bit more confident than you actually are. Your strengths
      are more important than your weaknesses when you\u2019re applying for a job.
      Employers want to know what you bring to the company and team. Everyone has
      weaknesses. Your strengths are how you stand out. I probably have talked about
      this for long enough. Take this skill!"

    m_Localized: "See, you survived it! Do you know where you can find jobs? It might
      seem a bit difficult at first, but don\u2019t worry. There are many websites
      where employers post job advertisements. Ty\xF6markkinatori.fi, duunitori.fi,
      kuntarekry.fi, oikotie.fi, it\u2019s a long list. Keep an eye on as many sites
      as you can. Not all advertisements can be found in every website. I think that\u2019s
      it. You can take your skill here."

    m_Localized: "Good job! You probably did not need to prepare for this, but preparing
      itself is usually a good idea. You get asked questions in job interviews. You
      should prepare in advance by thinking about the answers to the most common
      questions. The Internet is a great tool for finding these questions. Don\u2019t
      panic though if you get asked a question that you don\u2019t know the answer
      to right away. It's not the end of the world. Oftentimes small research into
      the company is a big plus in giving a good general view of yourself. You can
      take this skill!"
